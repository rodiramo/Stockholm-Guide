            <h2>Origin of Stockholm</h2>
            <h3>The Viking City</h3>
            <p>The first mention of the city in manuscripts about the history of Stockholm was in the <strong>13th century.</strong> Previously, there had been Viking settlements in the old city of Birka, which was later abandoned to establish a new city. In 1252, <strong>Swedish King Birger Jarl founded Stockholm</strong> in the present-day Gamla Stan or Old Town, with the aim of establishing a defensive nucleus to <strong>protect Sweden from foreign invasions.</strong></p><br>
            <p>The <strong>location</strong> chosen for this emerging city was crucial for Stockholm's future development, as it is situated between Lake Malaren and the Baltic Sea. The population of this new city grew rapidly and spread across the small islands of the archipelago. Today, Stockholm stands on <strong>14 islands connected by 57 bridges.</strong></p><br>
            <p>However, the real rise of Stockholm as a city came when it joined the Hanseatic League, along with other trading cities in Scandinavia like Oslo and Copenhagen. <strong>In 1436, Stockholm became the capital of Sweden.</strong></p><br>

            <h2>The Stockholm Bloodbath</h2>
            <p>The Modern Age in Stockholm was marked by the succession of kings and continuous wars with other Scandinavian countries. <strong>In the 15th century, the kingdoms of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark were united under the same monarch in what was known as the Kalmar Union.</strong> In 1448, Sweden attempted to separate from this coalition, leading to the invasion of Norwegian troops.</p><br>
            <p>Danish King Christian II organized a banquet at the Royal Palace to celebrate his recent coronation and invited the most distinguished nobles, clergy, and politicians of Stockholm. What was to be a pleasant dinner to honor the new king turned into a <strong>trap</strong>, and <em>Christian II mercilessly executed all his guests in a night</em> known as the <strong>Stockholm Bloodbath</strong>. The bodies were piled up in the Stortorget square for days, and the rain and blood dyed the streets of Gamla Stan red.</p>

            <h2>Modern Stockholm</h2>
            <h3>The Perfect Civilization</h3>
            <p>By the end of the 19th century, Sweden transformed from an agricultural society to an industrial one. In 1850, Stockholm had a population of <strong>93,000</strong> and was rapidly growing. By the early 20th century, it had reached <strong>300,000 people.</strong></p><br>
            <p>However, <strong>by the mid-19th century, Stockholm was an unhealthy place</strong>. This was because there were no sewers or running water. Fortunately, all of that changed. <em>Stockholm began using gas lighting in 1853.</em> In the 1860s, a supply of running water was established. The National Museum was built in 1866.</p><br>
            <p>Stockholm escaped the damage caused by bombing during the <strong>Second World War.</strong> In the mid-20th century, a city modernization program began. Many old houses in Stockholm were demolished and replaced with new ones.</p><br>
            <p>Today, tourism is an important source of income for Stockholm. The Dance Museum opened its doors in 1953. The Medieval Museum opened in 1986. <strong>A ship called the Vasa sank in 1628,</strong> but was recovered in 1961 and is now displayed in a museum. Today, Stockholm's population is nearly <strong>1 million inhabitants.</strong></p>
